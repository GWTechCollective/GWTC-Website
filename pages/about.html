			<h1>About Us</h1><hr>

			<p>GW Tech Collective is a group of students at the George Washington University interested in technology and innovation. We pursue our interests through a combination of workshops, trips, lectures, and social events. We are open to all ideas. If you want to work on a project or learn more about a subject feel free to talk to us. We may not have the answers but we will at least try to point you in the right direction. If you are excited about any topic loosely related to science, technology, or engineering we are probably excited about it too.</p>

			<p>Questions? Please contact <em>info at gwtechcollective.org</em></p>
